## 1. SWIG

>When SWIG is used as it is distributed by the SWIG developers, its output is not governed by SWIG's license (including the GPL). SWIG's output contains code from three sources:
>
> - code generated by SWIG, which is not governed by copyright;
> - code copied from the SWIG library which is permissively licensed to be redistributed without restriction;
> - code derived from the user's input, which may be governed by the license of the code supplied by the user.
>
>So, while the input supplied to SWIG may affect the license of SWIG's output (e.g. if the input code is licensed under a copyleft or proprietary license), SWIG's license does not affect the license of the output. This is consistent with the FSF's FAQ entries on this subject ([GPLOutput](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLOutput) and [WhatCaseIsOutputGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatCaseIsOutputGPL)), because the SWIG code copied into the output by SWIG is not GPL-licensed.
